# Broadway

In this project, I have used properties such as  `display`  and  `position`  to improve the layout of the landing page for a fictional design firm, Broadway Design.

The site has some style rules to begin with. I have improved the layout and positioning of the navigation menu at the top of the page and the three supporting sections (Design, Develop, Deploy) below the image.

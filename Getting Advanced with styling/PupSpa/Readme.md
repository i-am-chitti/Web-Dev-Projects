# PupSpa

Practicing Native CSS Grid through building a classic, grid-based, responsive web page. one of our friend has just opened a doggie daycare and grooming services shop, PupSpa. They would like a simple web page to let customers know about their services.

First I have build a grid layout for desktop then, added CSS rules for mobile screens.

# **Web Dev Projects**
This repository contains website development codes. I have included and will be including the codes of projects which I have completed on various online platforms as well as self developed projects.
The name of repository provides a glimpse of what has been implemented inside. So, if it is <mark>Building Persistent APIs</mark>, then it would contain codes related to Node Js express routes and routers.

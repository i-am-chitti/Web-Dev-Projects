Using  `fetch`,  `async`, and  `await`, we’ll request information from the  [Foursquare API](https://developer.foursquare.com/)  and  [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/current)  to create a travel website.

Before you begin, you’ll need to register for developer accounts for both of the APIs above. They’re both free.

For Foursquare, once you make an account,  [create a new app](https://foursquare.com/developers/register)  and fill out the form (you can put any link in the “App or Company URL” field). The Foursquare API will then give you a client ID and a client secret. You’ll need to save both of those in  **main.js**.

For OpenWeather, follow the instructions for the  [I. Registration process: How to start](https://openweathermap.org/guide/#how). When prompted, use your first name, and  `other`  for the OpenWeather questions for their data collection. OpenWeather will give you an API Key, which you’ll also need to save in  **main.js**.

Now, We are good to go!

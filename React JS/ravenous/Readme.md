# Ravenous

In total, there are four parts of this project:
-   Creating Static Components
-   Passing Information to Components
-   Setting the State of Ravenous Components
-   Interacting with the Yelp API

Hereâ€™s a quick overview of how Ravenous should function:
-   As a user, I should be able to search for restaurants
-   As a user, I should be able to view a list of restaurants returned by the Yelp API
-   As a user, I should be able to sort through restaurants using a filter

__Requirements__

* Node js
* Command Line Terminal

__Quick Start__

This project is already in production phase, not in development phase. So, to start this app, one can use static server and let it handle all works itself. Run these commands in any CLI from ReactJs directory.

>>npm install -g serve

>>serve -s ravenous
